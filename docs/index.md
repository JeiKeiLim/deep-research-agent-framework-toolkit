# Welcome to DRAFT

DRAFT (Deep Research Agent Framework Toolkit) is a multi-agent research framework that uses AI agents to plan, search, synthesize, and critique to produce high-quality research answers with live progress and observability.

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to understanding, using, and extending the DRAFT framework.

## Key Features

- **Modular Multi-Agent System**: Specialized agents for planning, searching, synthesizing, and critiquing.
- **Extensible and Composable**: Easily create new agents and tools to extend the framework's capabilities.
- **Live Progress and Observability**: Monitor the research process in real-time with Langfuse tracing.
- **Multi-Source Knowledge Retrieval**: Integrates with various knowledge sources like Weaviate, Perplexity, and Tavily.
- **Conversation History**: Persistently stores and retrieves past conversations for context-aware research.
