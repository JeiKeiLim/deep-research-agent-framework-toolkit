Fermentation (jang, jeotgal) is foundational. [source](turn0search8) [source](turn0search15)  \n- **Two-source pantry:** west-coast mudflats/sea (Chungnam) + inland rivers/plains (Chungbuk) ‚Üí seafood + freshwater produce; lots of soups, stews, and **gukbap** (rice-in-soup). [source](turn0search0) [source](turn1search4)\n\n## Signature things to try\n- **Ganggyeong jeotgal (fermented salted seafood), Nonsan** ‚Äî one of Korea‚Äôs largest/oldest salted-seafood markets; hallmark Chungnam seasoning. Visit in Oct for the Jeotgal Festival. [source](turn0search1) [source](turn0search5) [source](turn1search6)  \n- **Gulbap (oyster rice), Boryeong** ‚Äî west-coast oysters cooked with rice; also grilled/steamed oysters and oyster kalguksu common around Cheonbuk Oyster Complex. [source](turn3search1) [source](turn3search6)  \n- **Gamtae (delicate mudflat seaweed), Seosan‚ÄìGarorim Bay** ‚Äî rare, winter-harvested seaweed now prized by chefs; uniquely grows on mudflats in Garorim Bay. [source](turn4search1) [source](turn1search8)  \n- **Olgaenggi-guk (marsh-snail soup), Cheongju & Chungbuk** ‚Äî earthy, doenjang-based soup with snails, chives, and curled mallow; a representative Chungcheong comfort food. [source](turn2search12) [source](turn2search5)  \n- **Janggukbap (soy-seasoned beef broth over rice)** ‚Äî classic market-style gukbap with ganjang-seasoned beef stock and vegetables.

The order will likely authorize penalties if political bias is found in customer de-risking processes.\n\n- Critics argue that banks act based on AML/KYC risk, not ideology.\n- JPMorgan and BofA deny accusations of bias.\n- This move aligns with Trump‚Äôs 2025 campaign messaging focused on anti-establishment grievances.\n\n**Sources:**\n- https://www.reuters.com/world/us/white-house-target-banks-trump-claims-discrimination-2025-08-06/\n- https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/08/05/trump-de-banking-conservatives/\n\n## üáÆüá≥ U.S. Tariffs on Indian Imports Amid Trade Tensions\n\nOn August 6, the U.S. announced a new **25% tariff** on a wide range of Indian imports. This move comes after failed trade talks and U.S. criticism of India's continued purchase of discounted Russian oil.\n\n### Key points:\n- New tariffs affect apparel, electronics, auto parts, and jewelry.\n- The total tariff burden on some goods now exceeds 50%.\n- The administration says the tariffs will ‚Äúrebalance‚Äù trade fairness and discourage India‚Äôs alignment with Russia.\n\nIndia has not yet responded with retaliatory tariffs but has expressed ‚Äúdeep disappointment.‚Äù\n\n**Sources:**\n- https://www.reuters.com/world/india/trump-imposes-additional-25-tariff-indian-goods-relations-hit-new-low-2025-08-06/\n- https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/08/06/us-imposes-new-tariffs-on-india-over-russia-ties\n\n## üçé Apple‚Äôs $100 Billion U.S. Investment Pledge\n\nThe White House confirmed that Apple will invest **$100 billion more** into U.S.-based manufacturing, adding to its previously announced $500 billion reshoring plan. The investment focuses on:\n\n- Expanding advanced manufacturing facilities (e.g., server components for AI).\n- Building R&D centers in North Carolina and Ohio.\n- Workforce development initiatives tied to semiconductor and AI hardware assembly.\n\nThe pledge follows ongoing tariff uncertainty with China and is framed as part of the U.S. industrial policy to boost tech sovereignty.\n\n**Sources:**\n- https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/apple-pledge-100-billion-us-manufacturing-white-house-official-says-2025-08-06/\n- https://financialbuzz.com/apple-pledges-additional-100-billion-to-u-s-manufacturing/\n- https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-to-announce-100-billion-manufacturing-investment-in-us-white-house-official/articleshow/123145828.cms\n\n## üèõÔ∏è Congress in Recess ‚Äî Government Shutdown Looms\n\nCongress is in August recess.

The AGC was programmed using a specialized low-level language known as **AGC assembly** (also called **AGC assembly language** or **AGC assembler**).\n\n- **Development timeline:**\n  - Work on the AGC started around **1961‚Äì1962**.\n  - The AGC assembly language was actively developed and in use by **1965**.\n  - Apollo 11 landed on the Moon in **July 1969**.\n\n- **Key characteristics of AGC assembly:**\n  - Custom-designed for the AGC‚Äôs 15-bit word architecture.\n  - Very memory-efficient due to tight hardware constraints (just 36 KB of read-only memory and 2 KB of RAM).\n  - Source code is available and preserved (e.g., the Apollo 11 guidance code: [https://github.com/chrislgarry/Apollo-11](https://github.com/chrislgarry/Apollo-11)).\n\n- **Instruction set and development tools:**\n  - The language featured symbolic instructions like `TC`, `AD`, `MASK`, `CAF`, `TCAA`, etc.\n  - Tools like **YUL assembler** were used to translate symbolic code into binary.\n\n**Sources:**\n- [MIT AGC History](https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/)\n- [AGC source code GitHub mirror](https://github.com/chrislgarry/Apollo-11)\n- [The Apollo Guidance Computer: Architecture and Operation](https://www.doneyles.com/LM/Tales.html)\n\n---\n\n### ü§ñ Backpropagation and Neural Networks\n\nBackpropagation is a core algorithm used for training **artificial neural networks** by calculating gradients via the **chain rule**.\n\n- **Historical development:**\n  - The mathematical principles were known earlier (e.g., by Paul Werbos in his 1974 Ph.D. thesis).\n  - However, the **first widely recognized peer-reviewed publication** of the algorithm was by **David E. Rumelhart, Geoffrey E. Hinton, and Ronald J. Williams** in **1986**:\n    - **Title:** Learning representations by back-propagating errors\n    - **Published in:** *Nature*, 1986\n    - This paper sparked a resurgence in neural network research.\n\n**Sources:**\n- Rumelhart, Hinton & Williams (1986): [https://www.nature.com/articles/323533a0](https://www.nature.com/articles/323533a0)\n- Werbos Ph.D. thesis (1974): [https://www.proquest.com/openview/4adbb3d9cf63a9fbb9e3fa2f3771f1ad/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750](https://www.proquest.com/openview/4adbb3d9cf63a9fbb9e3fa2f3771f1ad/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750)\n\n---\n\n## üß† Final Comparison\n\n| Aspect                            | Apollo 11 AGC Assembly Language      | Backpropagation (peer-reviewed)   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Developed/Published               | ~1965                                | 1986                              |\n| Used in Operational Mission       | Apollo 11, 1969                      | Not used in practice until much later |\n| Type                              | Low-level assembly for embedded systems | Algorithm for training neural networks |\n| Major Publication                 | Not applicable (in-house at MIT/NSA) | *Nature*, Rumelhart et al.
