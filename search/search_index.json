It breaks down the research task into smaller, manageable steps.</li> <li>Search: The search agent executes the research plan by querying various knowledge sources and tools. It can interact with knowledge bases like Weaviate, and web search services like Perplexity and Tavily.</li> <li>Synthesizer: This agent takes the evidence gathered by the search agent and synthesizes it into a comprehensive and coherent answer.</li> <li>Critic: The critic agent evaluates the quality of the synthesized answer and provides feedback for improvement. This iterative process ensures the final output is of high quality.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"architecture/#key-components","title":"Key Components","text":"<p>DRAFT is built upon a set of key components that provide the foundation for its functionality:</p> <ul> <li>Agent Framework: We use the OpenAI Agents SDK as the backbone of our agent framework, with custom output types to handle structured data.</li> <li>Knowledge Base: DRAFT uses Weaviate as its default vector database for knowledge storage and retrieval.</li> <li>Web Search: The framework integrates with Perplexity API and Tavily for real-time web search capabilities.</li> <li>MCP Integration: DRAFT supports external capability servers through the Multi-Agent Capability Protocol (MCP). This allows for the integration of external tools and services.</li> <li>Observability: We use Langfuse for tracing and observability, providing real-time insights into the agent's operations.</li> <li>GUI: A Gradio-based web interface is provided for easy interaction with the framework.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"architecture/#agent-orchestration","title":"Agent Orchestration","text":"<p>DRAFT supports two modes of agent orchestration:</p> <ul> <li><code>agent</code> mode (default): In this mode, a single orchestrator agent manages the entire research process with streaming updates.</li> <li><code>sequential</code> mode: This mode follows a more explicit workflow of plan \u2192 search \u2192 synthesize \u2192 critique, with a configurable number of revision iterations. (We are planning to deprecate this mode in the future.)</li> </ul> <p>This modular architecture allows for the flexible composition of agents and tools, making it easy to extend and adapt the framework to different research needs.</p>"},{"location":"contributing/","title":"Contributing","text":"<p>We welcome contributions to the DRAFT framework!

Create a Prompt File","text":"<p>Next, create a new prompt file in the <code>prompts/</code> directory with the same name as specified in your agent's configuration.

Define an Output Type (Optional)","text":"<p>The output type of an agent is determined automatically based on the agent's name. The framework looks for a Pydantic model in <code>src/draft_agents/output_types/</code> with a class name that matches the agent's name in PascalCase. For example, if your agent's name is <code>my_agent</code>, the framework will look for a class named <code>MyAgent</code> in <code>src/draft_agents/output_types/__init__.py</code>.</p> <p>If a matching Pydantic model is not found, the output type defaults to <code>str</code>.</p> <p>To define a custom output type, you need to:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Create a Pydantic model in a new Python file in <code>src/draft_agents/output_types/</code>. For example, <code>src/draft_agents/output_types/my_agent.py</code>:</p> <pre><code>from pydantic import BaseModel, Field\n\nclass MyAgent(BaseModel):\n    result: str = Field(description=\"The result of the agent's task.\")\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Import the new model in <code>src/draft_agents/output_types/__init__.py</code>:</p> <pre><code># src/draft_agents/output_types/__init__.py\n\nfrom src.draft_agents.output_types.critic import CriticFeedback\nfrom src.draft_agents.output_types.evaluator import EvaluatorFeedback\nfrom src.draft_agents.output_types.planner import SearchItem, SearchPlan\nfrom src.draft_agents.output_types.my_agent import MyAgentOutput # Add this line\n\noutput_types = {\n    \"Planner\": SearchPlan,\n    \"Critic\": CriticFeedback,\n    \"Evaluator\": EvaluatorFeedback,\n    \"MyAgent\": MyAgentOutput,  # Add your new agent here\n}\n</code></pre> </li> </ol> <p>Now, when you run your agent, the framework will automatically use the <code>MyAgent</code> Pydantic model as the output type.</p>"},{"location":"creating-agents/#4-integrate-your-agent","title":"4.
